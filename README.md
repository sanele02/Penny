# Penny 💰

Penny is a **digital tipping web application** that allows users to tip other users by entering a username, tip amount, and an optional message.  
The project demonstrates a simple user authentication flow and a basic peer-to-peer tipping concept.

Penny was built as a learning project to explore user accounts, form handling, and fintech-inspired ideas in web development.
